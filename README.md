<h1 align='center'>Welcome to Bloom!<br> Bloom is a goal tracking website meant to help you visualize and see your progress</h1>

&nbsp;

<p>The goal of Bloom is to provide a way to visualy track your progress within three separate life categories: Mental, Physical and Spiritual,
           since we often cannot see our individual progress until we step back and take a look at the bigger picture. The reason for the three categories
           is to provide us a way to compare our progress between them in order to help us become a well-rounded person. Our method of visualization is a little
           tree that grows with you as you accomplish your goals and habits </p>
